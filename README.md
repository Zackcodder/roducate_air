# roducate_air

## Getting Started

This mobile application was developed using the DART programming language in line with the FLUTTER framework. In the course of development, some of the library used are as follows:  1. flutter native splash: This is used for the creation of the splach screen used  and seen upon first launch of the app                                                               2. flutter launch icon: this is used in creation of different app icon for both the android and iOS platform that shows on the user phone.
